= This is a good example

This is a good example of AsciiDoc as it doesn't follow the "one line per sentence" rule.
If you just write each sentence after each other the diff's and therefore merges are getting worse to handle.
Markdown and AsciiDoc will handle single new lines as blanks.
In the rendered output no difference can be spotted.

Run this example with
`git diff --no-index one-line-per-sentence.good-1.adoc one-line-per-sentence.good-2.adoc`.
