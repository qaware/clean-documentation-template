= Clean Documentation Template

////
TODOs:
* Add repo descriptions
* Add antora and vale code
* Add nice start page generated with jekyll
////

This repo shows how
https://github.com/alex0ptr[Alex Krause (@alex0ptr)]
and
https://github.com/aeimer[Alexander Eimer (@aeimer)]
think how AsciiDoc, Antora and vale can be used to document your software and product better.

You can find the rendered Antora docs

== Structure

This repo has two main parts, the first can be found under
xref:templates/[templates]
and provide standalone files which can be used within the next part.

The second part shows how to set up a working Antora and all the by us suggested  tooling.
Almost any other files not under the `templates` directory belongs to this part.
The templates provided are our suggestion to use within the documentation structure.

== Content

== Differences to the real world

As this is a template which is contained within one repo, there are some differences to a real world setup.

* As
https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/#where-is-a-playbook-stored[suggested by Antora]
the playbook and the configuration files are stored in a separate repository.
Having a "docs" repo with the playbook, config and some documentation content together works for some setups well, always look at your use-case.
If in doubt start small and adapt if you grow.

* You probably want to have different repos as source defined in the `antora-playbook.yml` with branches or tags as references which state to use.

== Using the Taskfile

https://taskfile.dev[`Taskfile`]
is a `Makefile` on steroids.
You need to install Taskfile globally to use it.

[source,bash]
----
# Install Taskfile via brew
brew install go-task

# Show all tasks available
task

# Render documentation
task generate

# Render documentation and open in browser
task generate open

# Open rendered documentation with http server
task serve
----
