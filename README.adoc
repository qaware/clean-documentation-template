== Structure

This repo has two main parts, the first can be found under
xref:templates/[templates]
and provide standalone files which can be used within the next part.

The second part shows how to set up a working Antora and all the by us suggested  tooling.
Almost any other files not under the `templates` directory belongs to this part.
The templates provided are our suggestion to use within the documentation structure.
