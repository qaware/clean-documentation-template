= Recover a deleted database

Restoring a deleted database can be quite complex, and the exact steps may vary depending on the specific database system you are using, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
Below are some general guidelines for restoring a deleted database.

== General Guidelines

* Stop Using the Server:
** Immediately stop using the server to prevent new data from overwriting the deleted files.

* Check Backups:
** The most reliable method is to restore from a backup. Check if you have recent backups and restore from there.

* Recovery Tools:
** Use database-specific recovery tools provided by your database vendor or third-party recovery software.

== Database-Specific Guidelines

=== MySQL

* From Backup:
** If you have a recent backup, use the `mysql` command-line tool to restore:
+
[source,shell]
----
mysql -u username -p database_name &lt; backupfile.sql
----

* InnoDB Recovery:
** For InnoDB databases, you might need to use the `innodb_force_recovery` option in the MySQL configuration file.

* Recovery Tools:
** Tools like `MySQL Enterprise Backup` or `Percona Data Recovery Toolkit` can be helpful.

=== PostgreSQL

* From Backup:
** Use the `pg_restore` command to restore from a `.dump` file:
+
[source,shell]
----
pg_restore -U username -d database_name backup_file.dump
----

* Point-in-Time Recovery:
** Use Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) if you have Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files.

* Recovery Tools:
** Tools like `pgBackRest` or `Barman` can be helpful.

=== SQL Server

* From Backup:
** Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a T-SQL script to restore from a backup:
+
[source,sql]
----
RESTORE DATABASE database_name
FROM DISK = 'backupfile.bak'
WITH RECOVERY;
----

* Point-in-Time Recovery:
** Use point-in-time restore to recover the database to a specific moment.

* Recovery Tools:
** Tools like `Redgate` or `LiteSpeed` can be useful.

== Steps for Restoring from Backup

* Locate Backup:
** Find your most recent backup file.

* Restore Process:
** Initiate the restore process using your database's specific commands or tools.

* Verification:
** Verify the restored database to ensure data integrity.

=== Example (MySQL)

.Backup:
[source,shell]
----
mysqldump -u root -p database_name &gt; database_name_backup.sql
----

.Restoration:
[source,shell]
----
mysql -u root -p database_name &lt; database_name_backup.sql
----

=== Example (PostgreSQL)

.Backup:
[source,shell]
----
pg_dump -U username database_name &gt; database_name_backup.sql
----

.Restoration:
[source,shell]
----
psql -U username -d database_name -f database_name_backup.sql
----

=== Example (SQL Server)

.Backup:
[source,sql]
----
BACKUP DATABASE database_name
TO DISK = 'C:\backup\database_name.bak';
----

.Restoration:
[source,sql]
----
RESTORE DATABASE database_name
FROM DISK = 'C:\backup\database_name.bak'
WITH RECOVERY;
----

Always make sure to have regular backups and a well-documented disaster recovery plan in place to mitigate data loss in the future.
If the standard methods don't work, consulting with a database administrator or a professional data recovery service might be necessary.
