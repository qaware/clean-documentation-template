= Branching strategy

A branching strategy is a specific approach used by software development teams to manage the development of new features, bug fixes, and other updates within a version control system like Git.
It helps in organizing code changes and ensuring that the final product is stable and maintainable.
Several common branching strategies exist, each suitable for different types of projects and team structures.

== Git Flow

Git Flow is a popular branching strategy proposed by Vincent Driessen.
It introduces a structured branching model with multiple long-lived branches:
- `master`: The main branch containing stable code that is ready for production.
- `develop`: A branch for integrating features and fixes before merging them into the master.
- `feature/*`: Short-lived branches created from `develop` for developing new features.
- `release/*`: Branches for preparing releases; they help in final bug fixing and preparation before merging into `master` and `develop`.
- `hotfix/*`: Used to quickly address critical bugs found in production.

This strategy is suitable for teams following a disciplined release cycle, ensuring stability and quality.

== GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a simpler, more streamlined approach predominantly used in continuous integration and deployment environments.
It involves the following:
- `main`: The default branch which always has deployable code.
- `feature/*` or `branch/*`: Short-lived branches created from `main` for new work.
Changes are committed to these branches and merged back into `main` through pull requests.
This ensures that the `main` branch is always stable and deployable.

This strategy is ideal for teams needing rapid deployment and continuous delivery.

== GitLab Flow

GitLab Flow incorporates aspects of both Git Flow and GitHub Flow, providing flexibility based on an organization's deployment needs.
Key branches include:
- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `develop` or `staging`: Integration and testing environments.
- `feature/*`: Branches for new features or fixes, merged into `develop` or `staging`.
- Release management can involve tagging commits on the `main` branch or using specific release branches.

This strategy works well for teams with complex workflows and multiple environments.

== Trunk-Based Development

In trunk-based development, all developers work on a single long-lived branch, commonly referred to as `trunk` or `main`.
Developers frequently commit their changes directly to this branch and continuously integrate their modifications.
This strategy promotes rapid integration and reduces merge conflicts by keeping all code changes in a single place.
Feature branches are avoided or kept extremely short-lived.

Trunk-based development is suitable for high-paced environments where frequent releases and continuous integration are critical.

== Choosing the Right Strategy

Choosing the right branching strategy depends on several factors:
- Team size and structure.
- Frequency of releases.
- Stability and deployment requirements.
- Integration and testing workflows.

By carefully considering these factors, teams can select a branching strategy that opt
