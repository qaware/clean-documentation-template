Dependency maintenance routine guide

This section provides a checklist for managing dependency updates in the software project.
Regular maintenance ensures the incorporation of improvements, security fixes, and new features while maintaining system stability.
Following a structured routine enables smooth handling of dependency updates and reduces technical debt.

Process Overview:

. *Review merge requests by dependabot / renovate*:
* Check the changes proposed in the MR, including diff and commit messages.
* Understand the context and impact of the updates.

. *Dependency updates*:
* Verify the list of updated dependencies and their version changes.
* Review release notes for breaking changes, deprecations, or relevant fixes.

. *Assignment and ownership*:
* Assign the MR to yourself or the appropriate team member for detailed review and feedback.

. *Testing updates*:
* Test changes locally or in a staging environment to ensure compatibility.
* Use automated pipelines for regression testing where applicable.

. *Pipeline validation*:
* Verify the execution of pipelines and resolve any errors.
* Regularly monitor nightly tests for hidden issues.

. *Merge changes*:
* Merge updates once testing and reviews are complete.
* Follow project-specific commit message guidelines.

. *Dockerfile and CI images*:
* Check and update Dockerfiles for base images and tools.
* Test and verify new image builds before deployment.

. *Security considerations*:
* Prioritize and assess the impact of security fixes.
* Coordinate urgent releases for high-severity vulnerabilities.

. *Helm charts and falco rules*:
* Review changes in Helm charts and configuration.
* Test new or updated Falco rules and resolve false positives.

. *Monitoring post-update*:
* Monitor for new errors or events caused by updates.
* Address issues promptly and iterate as needed.
